## 📖 Project Overview

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. This project aims to serve as an **educational and screening-support tool** that uses machine learning to identify individuals at high risk, encouraging them to seek professional medical advice.

**Key Features:**
- **Risk Prediction:** Estimates the probability of heart disease based on 13 clinical features.
- **Intelligent Recommendations:** Provides tailored lifestyle and medical advice based on a 5-level risk system.
- **Model Comparison:** Implements and evaluates four different ML algorithms to find the most effective one.
- **Ethical by Design:** Emphasizes that the tool is for guidance only and not a replacement for a medical diagnosis.

## 📊 Dataset

We used the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset**, a widely-used benchmark in medical ML.

- **Source:** https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease
- **Samples:** 1,025  
- **Features:** 13 clinical attributes (age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, maximum heart rate, etc.)  
- **Target:** Binary (0 = No Disease, 1 = Heart Disease)
